- I am currently working as an outsourced **React Native** developer while in Codeventure.

- **FreshDirect** is a **New York-based** delivery service owned by **Getir**. I am currently working as a **React Native** developer.

- Organization is totally **English** and I managed to cooperate with various developers **around the world** and developed new modules that **improved performance and marketing**.

- This is a great chance for me to observe a big organization, collaborate with different teams and make improvements to a living app that is being used by **thousands of people** every day.

- Furthermore; I used TypeScript, React Native, Jira, Git, Apollo Graphql.
