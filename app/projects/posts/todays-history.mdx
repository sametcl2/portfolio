History is my **hobby** project.

- It shows what happened (events, births, deaths, etc. ) on specific day on history. User can select any date wants. Data is provided by **Wikipedia** and user can reach related articles about topic.

- It designed for **simplicity**. Provides a **clear**, **clutter-free** experience, allowing you to focus on the stories behind each date. Perfect for history lovers and curious minds alike.
